Only Win64 for now!

Download and put the dll in your VST2 directory.  Possbily you'll need your host  to re-scan that directory.
Tested in Cantabile 3, Cubase LE & Reaper.


If the plugin does not work you may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable from the link below.  Per V0.8.0 that should no longer be neccessary.
