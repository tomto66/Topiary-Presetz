Only Win64 for now!

Download and put the dll in your VST2 directory.  Possibily you'll need your host  to re-scan that directory.
Tested in Cantabile 3, Cubase LE & Reaper.

In version 1.1.0 the plugin identifiers changed, so your DAW will see 1.1.0 and onwards as different plugins than the ones before.  You can export the plugin state as if was and reload into 1.1.0 or higher.

Older versions are here as well - just rename them if you want to use them.

If the plugin does not work you may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable from the link below.  Per V0.8.0 that should no longer be neccessary.
