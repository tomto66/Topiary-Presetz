# Topiary-Presetz 0.9.2

Topiary Presetz is a plugin that allows the user to define 8 sets of "mix settings", and apply those at the touch of a button. Transition from one setting to another can be quantized and timed relative to the (host) transport.

* Topiary Presetz folder contains the code and a projucer file.
* Topiary folder contains code used by other Topiary modules; code is duplicated to make it easy for you :).

## Compile yourself

In order to compile, you will need JUCE and the VST2 headers. Steinberg no longer provides these but you can find them in the Juce 5.3 repositories.

Careful: binary data is provided in the Topiary/JuceLibraryCode folder - make sure your projucer doesn't delete that!

## Compatibility / Testing

* Tested/Compiled with Juce 5.3 / Visual Studio 2017 / VST2 / Windows10/X64.
* Tested with no issues in Cantabile 3, Cubase LE and Reaper.

## Installing binaries

* Plugin is found under Topiary Presetz / binaries.  Feel free to rename it.
* Install in your VST2 plugin folder.  You host may need to rescan that folder.
* Microsoft .Net framework is needed; see manual for details (link below).
